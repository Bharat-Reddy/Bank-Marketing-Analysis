- Analyzed the prior marketing campaigns of a Portuguese Bank using various ML techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forests,Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost and predicted if the user will buy the Bankâ€™s term deposit or not

- Recommended, the marketing team, ways to better target customers using feature importance maps and business intuition
